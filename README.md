#### What is ZentaDex?

Zentadex is a decentralized exchange (DEX) is a cryptocurrency exchange which operates in a decentralized way, i.e.,
without a central authority or it is an exchange market that does not rely on a third-party service to hold the customer's funds. 
Decentralized exchanges allow peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies.

The most obvious benefit to using a decentralized exchange over a centralized one is their "trustless" nature.
You are not required to trust the security or honesty of the exchange since the funds are held by you in your personal wallet and not by a third party.

Another advantage to the decentralized model is the privacy it provides.
Users are not required to disclose their personal details to anyone, except if the exchange method involves bank transfers,
in which case your identity is revealed only to the person that is selling or buying from you.
